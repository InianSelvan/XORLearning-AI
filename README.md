# XORLearning-AI
Neural Network algorithm for learning XOR - BackPropagation 

This is the model of my Neural net structure,  And the table below shows EXOR output. This Neural net is trained to learn EXOR.

This is a binary representation.
For 10 different runs, the average error at which it got converged less than 0.05 is 2533.
For more details on the data excel is attached with this document.
X – axis is total number of Epoch
Y – Total Error

This is a bipolar representation.
For 10 different runs, the average error at which it got converged less than 0.05 is 183.
For more details on the data excel is attached with this document.
X – axis is total number of Epoch
Y – Total Error

This is a bipolar with momentum representation.
For 10 different runs, the average error at which it got converged less than 0.05 is 35.
